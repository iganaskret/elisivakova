          Exam project in the end of second semester. In collaboration with
          Andry Deliana. She is 19 years old artist and Architecture student
          from Italy. I worked on this project with Andrea Makarová and Iga
          Naskręt. Our task was to expand Andry’s online presence by building a
          website, that would serve Andry as both an artistic portfolio and a
          platform for selling her products.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the process of designing the website, we followed Andry’s wish to
          keep it clear and simple, with a small amount of colours. We used a
          navigation on the sides which is not a typical layout for a website
          but it keeps website more artistic. We decided on using the sans-serif
          fonts. With the unusual navigation and Andry’s art, which could be
          described as modern, we wanted the typography to fit the style of the
          website. We had the same reasoning for the colours-striving for
          minimalism. We used black, white and one accent colour-purple. These
          the colours used in the Tarot collection, and Andry’s favourite colour
          is purple, so she asked us to use it. We thought that it’s a good idea
          to have an accent colour to highlight some information.

          The logo we used is Andry’s original logo traced in Illustrator. It is
          also her Instagram name. We used the black version for the pages and
          outlines for the loader, to keep it minimalistic. The letters in the
          logo are in a hand-drawn by Andry. We came with another solution for
          the logo but she wants to keep her old logo.

          Video is focused on the target audience, so we choose 4 people from
          it. They are all creative, eye-catching and having fun young people.
          These guys are from different countries, of different age and
          passions. But they share the same interest, interest in the Tarot
          Collection. They want to stand out from the crowd, express themselves
          through their clothes and support a young unknown artist. People can
          relate to the models, they will see themselves in them, which will
          lead to buying a T-shirt.

          On the landing page, we used Andry’s photo that we shoot during the
          course of the project. We went for a black background to create a
          contrast with the white background of the website, without introducing
          a new color. We shot portrait pictures because we wanted the focus to
          be on her to introduce her to the users straightaway. We also wanted
          the pictures to show her personality, so we advised her to wear
          clothes and make-up she thinks show it best, and we shot close-up
          pictures. Besides this we took also product photos of t-shirt which we
          used for e-shop section.

        <p>
          We want to reach our target audience we are going to post pictures of
          t-shirts on models because we want to show to other people how to wear
          it and how does it look in real life. And also we want to repost
          pictures of other people who already bought t-shirts. So for this, we
          created a hashtag #tarotcollection which people can use for their
          photos and we will repost the best of them on our profile. Because we
          want to expand the Instagram account among new potential customers so
          we are going to make a giveaway once a month.
